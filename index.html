    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>This application goes through the very aspects of the class and the features that we have learned and will learn throughout the class</p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
    <p>We have learned so far, mostly HTML, some CSS and JavaScript.<br> Github is our main platform and we host websites from there as well.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Proposal Last Updated</h2>
    <p>The proposal was last updated approximately 2 weeks ago with the whole class updating the proposal </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Feature List</h2>
    <p>Features such as HTML and terminal are features that can be delivered in time and also the Python language as well</p>
   
    <br>

    <h2>Future Feature List</h2>
    <p>I wish we could go over at least just a brief overview of the other languages other than the ones we are going over right now</p>
   
    <br>
    
    <h2>Basic Technical Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have learned the basics of Sequences, Selections, and Loops </li>
        <li>I have gotten very familiar with the HTML language and can comfortably create my own products</li>
        <li>I have gotten very familiar with GitHub. It was very tough in the beginning but I understand it better now</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>Advanced Technical Features</h2>
    <p>I do not think I have done anything considered above and beyond but I believe I am very precise when it comes to the basics</p>
